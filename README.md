# Banking_Application
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/stroudnat/Banking_Application)

Capstone Full Mern Stack Banking Application with Mongodb Atlas for data, express for the server side API calls along with Firebase for authentication. There is simple styling imported from bootstrap along with routing coming from the react router DOM. 

## Installation/Usage

#### Packages
This banking application is a node application meaning npm is required to manage the modules which have been removed for github uploading. There are different dependencies in different folders from client and root folder, meaning both are node project folders with their own dependencies. It is important to makesure all are installed. To get the code fork the repo and download the dependencies in order to get functionality of the interface.

#### Deployment
For simple usage of this site, I have chosen heroku for hosting of my website. I am taking advantage of their free dynos and using GoDaddy to set the domain name for hosting here: http://www.nathan-stroudfullstackbankingapplication.com
